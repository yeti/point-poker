# Todos

* [ ] Add "Learn More" page
* [ ] Make a docker image to make it easy to drop onto AWS.
* [ ] Add reaction GIFs to the UI. This currently exists on the back-end but does not have a proper entry-point on the front-end (hint: run `window.reaction('party parrot')` in your browser console while playing).
* [ ] Write front-end unit tests.
* [ ] Write storybook stories for components.
* [ ] Move data store to something more scalable (ðŸ¤” Redis mayhaps?). Currently it just sits in memory in an object.
* [ ] Track pageviews to get an idea of usage metrics.
